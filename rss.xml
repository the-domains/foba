            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>WHAT IS FOBA?</h1><p>The Fair Oaks Beautification Association (FOBA) is an all-volunteer, non-profit community organization. FOBA was established in 1996 as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) group. FOBA’s mission is to improve the quality of life for residents for the North Fair Oaks neighborhood. Our community volunteer efforts have included planting and caring for over 400 street trees, installing traffic calming devices to make our streets safer, building and maintaining the parks and playground, organizing a neighborhood-wide garage sale event and social gatherings, coordinating a community gardening project, and producing our neighborhood newsletter Avenues. </p></article>]]></description>
